###IMPORTANT
How to make Tailwind CSS compile your ```src/assets/styles/index.scss``` and 
also generate utility classes from your tsx files in the ```darwinia-ui/src``` directory. 
* Go to your terminal and navigate to this project's 
```packages/darwinia-ui``` directory. 
* Run the code 
```npx tailwindcss -i ./src/assets/styles/index.scss -o ./src/assets/styles/autogenerated.css --watch```
in your terminal for Tailwind CSS in darwinia-ui to compile, don't close this terminal to keep watching the changes in your project.
* The generated file ```/src/assets/styles/autogenerated.css``` is already imported in ```darwinia-ui/src/index.ts``` for you so you don't need to re-import it anywhere else.
* Make sure that the file ```/src/assets/styles/autogenerated.css``` always exists in your project for darwinia-ui to function as required.
